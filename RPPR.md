# Research Design
This is planned as two successive exercises in documenting the information architecture of first the current CD2H project portfolio and then the interconnects between those projects and the operational activities of the CTSA hubs.

# Methodology
Information architecture is typically defined as the structural design of shared information environments (e.g., complex web sites and intranets) and usually focuses upon usability and findability. We will adapt these default practices to the reality of having little leverage over the already-running projects in the current phase of CD2H work and over the independent plans of the CTSA hubs and their informatics teams. The primary focus during the current grant period will be on identification and conceptual linkage of information sources and flows, with an eye towards how these might be adapted in future phases of the grant.

As various elements of the overall CD2H project reach a sufficent level of maturity, they will be added to [CD2H Labs](http://labs.cd2h.org) for evaluation by the CTSA Community. Fully mature projects will then be migrated to the CD2H production website and/or the NCATS cloud, as appropriate. Similary, as projects and tools external to CD2H are identified, they will be added into the mix, further enabling their utilization.  The resulting "app store" should significantly enable existing and new CTSA hubs in selection and utilization of a broad range of tools.

# Expected Outcomes
* Improved recognition of existing information sources, both within CD2H (phase 1) and the CTSA Consortium (phase 2)
* Identification of logical points of interconnection between information sources and sinks, with a particular focus on the potential reduction of duplicative effort
* An active market of CTSA-relevant tools fostering efficient utilization by hubs

# Deliverables
- **CD2H Information Architecture, Version 1**
  - Authoritative list of all information producing/consuming components of CD2H (including organizations, personnel and software)
  - List of information interconnects between components, including type of information and frequency
- **Prototype App Store**
  - An initial suite of CD2H Tools (e.g., menRva) and external tools (e.g., SPARC) providing a basis for evaluation of the storefront
- **CD2H/CTSA Information Architecture, Version 2**
  - Component list extended to CTSA Consortium (but limited to those relevant to the CD2H mission)
  - Information interconnects similarly extended

# Timeline (monthly)
* 9/1 - v.1 CD2H information architecture
* 9/1 - prototype app store deployment
* 1/1 - v.2 CD2H/CTSA information architecture (only those relevant to our charter)

# Potential Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies

The overall scope of this project is substantially underspecified, as it is beginning primarily as a wrapper for the role
of chief information architect that Eichmann agreed to take on Spring 2019. Our current plan is to conduct this as a
relatively "pure" information architecture exercise, initially mapping information sources and flows within the CD2H
organization in an initial phase, and then expanding to interconnections with and between the CTSA hubs in a second phase.
We will assess the utility of the work completed in the initial phase as part of our fall meeting plans with the intention
of adjusting activity for the second phase based upon reception of and feedback from the hubs.
