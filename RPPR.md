# Research Design
This is planned as two successive exercises in documenting the information architecture of first the current CD2H project portfolio and then the interconnects between those projects and the operational activities of the CTSA hubs.

# Methodology
Information architecture is typically defined as the structural design of shared information environments (e.g., complex web sites and intranets) and usually focuses upon usability and findability. We will adapt these default practices to the reality of having little leverage over the already-running projects in the current phase of CD2H work and over the independent plans of the CTSA hubs and their informatics teams. The primary focus during the current grant period will be on identification and conceptual linkage of information sources and flows, with an eye towards how these might be adapted in future phases of the grant.

# Expected Outcomes
* Improved recognition of existing information sources, both within CD2H (phase 1) and the CTSA Consortium (phase 2)
* Identification of logical points of interconnection between information sources and sinks, with a particular focus on the potential reduction of duplicative effort

# Timeline (monthly)
* 9/1 - v.1 CD2H architecture
* 1/1 - v.2 CD2H/CTSA architecture (only those relevant to our charter)

# Potential Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies

The overall scope of this project is substantially underspecified, as it is beginning primarily as a wrapper for the role
of chief information architect that Eichmann agreed to take on Spring 2019. Our current plan is to conduct this as a
relatively "pure" information architecture exercise, initially mapping information sources and flows within the CD2H
organization in an initial phase, and then expanding to interconnections with and between the CTSA hubs in a second phase.
We will assess the utility of the work completed in the initial phase as part of our fall meeting plans with the intention
of adjusting activity for the second phase based upon reception of and feedback from the hubs.
