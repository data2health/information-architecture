This is planned as two successive exercises in documenting the information architecture of first the current CD2H project portfolios and then the interconnects between those projects and the operational activities of the CTSA hubs.

# Potential Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies

The overall scope of this projects is substantially underspecified, as it is beginning primarily as a wrapper for the role
of chief information architect that Eichmann agreed to take on Spring 2019. Our current plan is to conduct this as a
relatively "pure" information architecture exercise, initially mapping information sources and flows within the CD2H
organization in an initial phase, and then expanding to interconnections with and between the CTSA hubs in a second phase.
We will assess the utility of the work completed in the initial phase as part of our fall meeting plans with the intention
of adjusting activity for the second phase based upon reception of and feedback from the hubs.
